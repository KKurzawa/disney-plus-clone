# Disney-Plus-Clone

## Description

A clone of the Disney+ website built with React, Vite, Tailwind, the TMBD API, and deployed with Vercel. This app was built by watching the tutorial listed in the credits below.
 
## Usage

This app was built as an excercise for me to further my React skills and get an introduction to Tailwind. Currently the only functional links are to the Disney+ website and my Github portfolio.  Future development will implement links on each movie poster to a page with information on the selected movie.
